# Jackpot Python
### What is that
A little project just to learn Python<br>
It's Y-Independent because im bored to make every single row slot independent and because i did it faster i can<br>

### Y-Independent? what is that
The code will only check if Y axis is the same, Example:<br>
<ins>**X**</ins> Y Y <br>
<ins>**X**</ins> Y Y <br>
<ins>**X**</ins> Y Y

It's so simple, like, very very simple, dont judge me ðŸ˜¢<br>
I plan on improving it and probably in future create a pygame or tkinter gui for that, on console looks really ugly!

__By the way, I created a video doing this game from scratch, go check it out! https://youtu.be/Csyg3R8NMV0__
